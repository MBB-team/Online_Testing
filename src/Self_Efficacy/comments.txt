Here are a few issues I've noticed:

- The grid is not shown once prior to asking how many flips one needs to achieve the target score
- When asked how many filps one needs to reach the target score, the target score is not visible (because it was given on the previous screen).
This should be corrected because people might have read too quickly what was the target score. Maybe this intermediary screen is not needed at all?
- During the encoding phase, the check on the 'full screen' mode seems to be done after the items are shown (maybe it should be done as it is done for the recall phase, ie item by item?)
- There seems to be a bug when one is asked whether one wants to see the grid again:
if one does not answer, then it goes directly to the recall phase (after something like 2secs). This should be self-paced.
-  The recall phase itself should be prompted with something like 'now you will be asked to recall the items'...
- The recall phase should be self-paced (now it goes from one item to the next with somehting like 1sec delay)
- ... and a simple instruction should be given (eg something like: 'click on the item you think is paired with this one')
- The feedback is ambiguous. You should tell participants how many correct guesses he made AND show him the responses he made and whether they were correct 

Note: I could not be bothered to finish the experiment, and therefore I do not know how it ends (I stoped after 8 trials or so)...
